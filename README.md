Natural Language Processing Project. Main goal of model is to predict the rating (only 1 or 5 rating cases used), using the text in the review.  Performed Exploratory Data Analysis on Yelp Reviews to understand Text Length, distributions, and correlations. Built NLP Models using techniques such as a Count Vectorizer, TF-IDF, and Scikit-Learn Pipelines. Trained Multiple Models such as a Naive Bayes Model and evaluted their performance to identify the most effective approach. Steps clearly outline to make the project easy to follow. Data comes from a Yelp Dataset file.
